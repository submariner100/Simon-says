Memory game where user has to pick the right order of Colors which progressively gets harder. 
This game was created in UIKit and animations were done by using the alpha methods. Auto constraints and stack views were used to set
up the main storyboard. The game can be played by 2 players and the player who remembers the correct order of colors wins the game.
